## 🏆 Records & Performance

Our robot holds the **record times** for both mazes in the course:

- 🔥 **Maze 1 Record - 2.20 sec** (previously 4.52 sec): [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4keCAInF54)
- 🔥 **Maze 2 Record - 3.63 sec** (previously 19 sec): [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t9GoRSy7xQ)

## Objective

The challenge: build an autonomous robot capable of navigating a maze, identifying a flame in any of four rooms, and extinguishing it.

- The bot starts from a designated position in the maze.
- It must navigate the maze with no human interference.
- All robots must fit in a bounding box with a base of 31 cm x 31 cm and a height of 27 cm.
- The bot cannot touch the candle or its base during the run.
- The bot cannot use any destructive or dangerous methods to put out the candle.
- It must come within 30 cm of the candle before it extinguishes the flame.
- The bot must solve all rooms with the same code and same initial conditions; you must scan and extinguish candles in rooms 1-3 before extinguishing room 4

> A successful run is timed based on when the flame in **Room 4** is extinguished, provided the bot would have stopped for any flame in earlier rooms. Runs were timed with frame-by-frame analysis. Time starts on the first frame your bot's LCD/LED lights up and ends when the candle is extinguished.
